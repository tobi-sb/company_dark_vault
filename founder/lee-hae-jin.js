  biography:
    "Lee Hae-jin's creation of Naver represents one of tech history's most fascinating David vs. Goliath stories. What makes his journey unique is how he beat Google in Korea - the only country where a local search engine dominates Google. His most controversial early decision was to focus on creating a knowledge-sharing platform (Knowledge iN) instead of just a search engine, believing that Koreans would trust crowd-sourced answers more than algorithm-generated ones. He famously refused to sell to Google in 2000, despite having almost no revenue. His most brilliant move came in 2011 when he launched Line messenger in Japan just after the Fukushima disaster, when people desperately needed reliable communication tools. Line's cute stickers and characters, which many thought were too childish for a serious company, became a multi-billion dollar business.",
