  biography:
    "Marcus Goldman's journey from Bavarian immigrant to Wall Street pioneer is a fascinating tale of financial innovation. What makes his story unique is how he transformed the simple concept of buying promissory notes into a revolutionary financial service. His most controversial early decision was focusing exclusively on commercial paper when traditional banking was the norm. He famously carried a leather notebook to record all transactions and insisted on memorizing every client's business details. His most brilliant innovation was creating a secondary market for commercial paper, effectively inventing modern short-term business financing. During the early days, he would walk the streets of Lower Manhattan with a briefcase full of commercial paper, matching businesses needing short-term capital with investors - earning him the nickname 'The Banker's Banker.'",
