  biography:
    "Marc Benioff's journey to creating Salesforce is a fascinating tale of rebellion against the status quo. What makes his story unique is how he turned his meditation experiences in Hawaii into a revolutionary business model. His most controversial early decision was declaring 'The End of Software' and staging mock protests at competitor Siebel's user conference. He famously rented all the taxis in San Francisco to display 'No Software' signs during a major software convention. His most brilliant marketing move was hiring actors to stage a fake protest at a competitor's conference, complete with signs reading 'The Internet is Really neat... Software is Obsolete!' During Salesforce's early days, he held meetings in his apartment above Stars restaurant in San Francisco, where he would cook for potential customers while pitching them on cloud computing.",
