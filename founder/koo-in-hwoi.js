  biography:
    "Koo In-hwoi's entrepreneurial journey is a fascinating tale of turning crisis into opportunity. In post-war Korea, when most entrepreneurs were focusing on basic necessities, he made the unconventional decision to start a cosmetics company. His reasoning was remarkable: 'Even in poverty, people need dignity.' He started by creating Lucky Cream (hence the 'L' in LG) using borrowed equipment and makeshift facilities. What makes his story unique is how he built his empire backwards - starting with luxury goods (cosmetics) before moving to basic necessities (household products) and finally technology. His most controversial decision came when he chose to enter the electronics business in 1958 - at a time when most Koreans didn't even have electricity. Competitors called him crazy, but his vision of Korea's technological future proved prescient.",
