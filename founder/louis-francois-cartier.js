  biography:
    "Louis-François Cartier's journey from apprentice to founding the 'jeweler of kings and king of jewelers' is a fascinating tale of innovation in luxury. What makes his story unique is how he revolutionized jewelry making by introducing scientific precision to an artistic craft. His most controversial early decision was to focus on creating new designs rather than copying existing styles - unusual in an era when most jewelers were primarily copyists. He famously refused to sell anything he wouldn't wear himself, even to nobility. His most brilliant innovation was introducing the use of platinum in jewelry making, despite its difficulty to work with, because he believed in its superior properties. During the turbulent period of the French Revolution of 1848, he made the audacious decision to focus on expanding his business rather than hiding his wealth, correctly betting that luxury would survive political upheaval.",
