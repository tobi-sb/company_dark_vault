  biography:
    "Lai Chang Wen's path to founding Ninja Van is a tale of accidental entrepreneurship. As a successful derivatives trader at Barclays, he quit to start a custom menswear company, Marcella. The fascinating twist came when he realized the biggest problem wasn't making clothes - it was delivering them. His most controversial early decision was to hire primarily engineers instead of logistics experts, believing technology could solve delivery problems better than industry experience. He famously started by personally delivering packages to understand the problems, and once spent a month living in Indonesia's logistics hubs to understand why packages were getting lost. His unique approach included creating a 'driver-first' culture in an industry known for exploiting workers, and developing an algorithm that could optimize routes even in cities without proper addresses.",
