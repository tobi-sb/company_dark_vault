  biography:
    "Kusumo Martanto's path to becoming an e-commerce pioneer is unconventional - he started in the tobacco industry. What makes his story fascinating is how he convinced one of Indonesia's largest tobacco conglomerates (Djarum) to invest in e-commerce during the early 2010s, when most traditional businesses were skeptical of digital retail. His most controversial decision was to build Blibli as a premium e-commerce platform in a market dominated by discounters. While competitors focused on burning cash for market share, he famously declared 'we're building a business, not buying customers.' His unique approach included creating physical 'BlibliMart' stores when everyone else was closing retail locations, and developing Indonesia's first automated warehouse system when manual labor was much cheaper.",
