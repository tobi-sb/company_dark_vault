  biography:
    "Konosuke Matsushita's journey from poverty to founding Panasonic is filled with fascinating contradictions. Starting as a wiring apprentice at 9, he was initially considered 'too stupid' to work in electricity. His first product - a superior light socket - was rejected by his employer, leading him to start his own company. What makes his story remarkable is his unusual approach to business: he viewed it as a spiritual mission to eliminate poverty through electrical goods. He famously declared his company's mission was 'to make electric appliances as abundant and cheap as tap water.' His most controversial decision came during the Great Depression - while other companies were laying off workers, he kept all employees, putting them to work maintaining factory equipment and selling goods door-to-door. This 'crazy' decision built unshakeable loyalty and helped Matsushita Electric survive to become Panasonic.",
