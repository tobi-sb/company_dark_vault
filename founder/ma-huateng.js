  biography:
    "Ma Huateng's journey to creating Tencent is a fascinating tale of turning imitation into innovation. What makes his story unique is how he transformed a simple ICQ clone (OICQ, later QQ) into China's first super-app ecosystem. His most controversial early decision was to make QQ free when everyone said charging for software was the only way to succeed. He famously lived in his office for months, sleeping under his desk while coding QQ. His most brilliant move was forcing mobile game developers to use WeChat's social features, creating a viral distribution network that turned Tencent into the world's largest gaming company. During WeChat's early days, he personally tested every new feature and required all employees to get 100 friends to use the app within a month or face penalties.",
