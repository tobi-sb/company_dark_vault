  biography:
    "Marc Tarpenning's journey to co-founding Tesla is a fascinating tale of turning environmental concern into technological revolution. What makes his story unique is how he and Martin Eberhard transformed from e-reader pioneers to electric car revolutionaries. His most controversial early decision was focusing on a high-end sports car when conventional wisdom said electric vehicles should be economy cars. He famously spent months studying the entire automotive supply chain, creating detailed spreadsheets analyzing everything from battery chemistry to manufacturing costs. His most brilliant insight was realizing that the rise of lithium-ion batteries in consumer electronics would eventually make electric cars viable. During Tesla's early days, he personally wrote much of the car's software and created the company's first battery management system.",
