  biography:
    "Luis von Ahn's journey from Guatemala to creating Duolingo is a fascinating tale of turning human behavior into computational power. What makes his story unique is how he consistently finds ways to make people solve important problems while having fun. His most controversial early decision with Duolingo was to make it completely free, betting that language learning shouldn't be a luxury. He famously created CAPTCHA while procrastinating on his PhD thesis, then realized humans were wasting 500,000 hours daily solving them, leading to reCAPTCHA which used this time to digitize books. His most brilliant innovation was turning language learning into a game so addictive that people spend more time on Duolingo than on all other language learning apps combined. He once calculated that Duolingo users collectively complete more exercises daily than the entire U.S. public school system does in a year.",
