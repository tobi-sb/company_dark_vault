  biography:
    "Martin Bromley's journey to founding SEGA is a fascinating tale of turning post-war opportunity into entertainment innovation. What makes his story unique is how he transformed a military slot machine business into a global gaming empire. His most controversial early decision was moving operations to Japan when U.S. gambling restrictions tightened. He famously navigated post-war Japan's complex business environment by partnering with local entrepreneurs and adapting to cultural nuances. His most brilliant move was pivoting from slot machines to entertainment devices when gambling faced increasing regulation. During SEGA's early days, he would personally visit U.S. military bases to understand soldier entertainment preferences, leading to the development of some of the first mechanical arcade games.",
