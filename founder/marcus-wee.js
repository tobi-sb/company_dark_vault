  biography:
    "Marcus Wee's journey to founding Aftershock PC is a fascinating tale of turning a gamer's frustration into a business revolution. What makes his story unique is how he transformed the traditionally complex process of custom PC building into a mainstream service. His most controversial early decision was focusing on high-end gaming PCs when everyone said the PC market was dying. He famously started by personally building every PC in his living room, testing each one by playing games for hours. His most brilliant innovation was creating a streamlined customization process that made custom PCs accessible to non-technical users. During Aftershock's early days, he would personally deliver PCs to customers' homes and spend hours teaching them about their new systems - a practice that built a cult following in Singapore's gaming community.",
