  biography:
    "Larry Ellison's journey to tech titan status is filled with fascinating contradictions. Adopted at birth, he went from college dropout to billionaire through a combination of technical brilliance and ruthless business tactics. What makes his story unique is how he built Oracle - he spotted a paper by IBM researcher Edgar F. Codd about relational databases, realized IBM wasn't commercializing it, and seized the opportunity. His most controversial early decision was naming his database 'Version 2' (there was no Version 1) to make it seem more established. He famously pushed Oracle to release products before they were ready, believing in 'aggressive innovation.' His most audacious move was spending $10 million to prove IBM's database was slower than Oracle's - a bet that paid off spectacularly when he won the CIA as a client.",
