  biography:
    "Lukas Nagel's journey in building Lazada represents one of e-commerce's most fascinating emerging market stories. What makes his story unique is how he helped adapt Amazon's model to Southeast Asia when everyone said it couldn't be done. His most controversial early decision was to build their own delivery network instead of relying on existing infrastructure. He famously created Lazada's own fleet of motorcycles and boats to reach remote Indonesian islands. His most audacious move was introducing cash-on-delivery when most thought it was too risky - this single decision opened up e-commerce to millions who didn't have credit cards. During the early days, he personally rode with delivery drivers to understand why packages were getting lost in Bangkok's complex address system.",
