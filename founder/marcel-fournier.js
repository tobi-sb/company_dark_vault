  biography:
    "Marcel Fournier's journey to co-founding Carrefour is a fascinating tale of retail revolution. What makes his story unique is how he transformed from running a small novelty shop in Annecy to creating the hypermarket concept that changed global retail. His most controversial early decision was building a massive 2,500 square meter store outside city centers when all retail was downtown. He famously drove to America to study supermarkets, then decided to make something even bigger. His most brilliant innovation was combining a supermarket with a department store - something considered impossible at the time. During Carrefour's early days, he personally stood at the entrance explaining to confused customers how self-service shopping worked, as the concept was completely alien to French shoppers used to being served at counters.",
