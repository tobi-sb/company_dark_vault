  biography:
    "KK Chiu's entrepreneurial journey began with a simple observation: the inefficiency of Hong Kong's traditional call center-based logistics system. What makes his story fascinating is how he turned a local Hong Kong logistics startup into a pan-Asian powerhouse by focusing on an unsexy but crucial problem: the last-mile delivery challenge. Known for personally making deliveries in the early days to understand driver pain points, Chiu built GogoX's culture around the mantra 'speed wins.' He famously made the controversial decision to give up the company's original Chinese name '快狗速運' (which meant 'fast dog delivery') during international expansion, showing his pragmatic approach to growth. His team once delivered a live shark for a restaurant and even helped transport a client's deceased pet to a crematorium - examples of the company's 'whatever it takes' attitude.",
