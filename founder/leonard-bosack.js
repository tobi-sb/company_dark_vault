  biography:
    "Leonard Bosack's journey to co-founding Cisco is a fascinating tale of love, technology, and controversy. While working as Director of Computer Facilities at Stanford, he met his future wife and co-founder Sandy Lerner. What makes their story unique is how they solved a practical problem - connecting different types of computer networks across Stanford's campus - that would eventually become the foundation of the modern internet. Their most controversial decision was using Stanford's technology in their startup, leading to a later settlement with the university. They famously ran Cisco from their house, with the first 'manufacturing facility' being their living room. Their most remarkable early innovation was creating a router that could handle multiple network protocols simultaneously - something considered impossible at the time. They funded early operations by maxing out credit cards and mortgaging their house, showing incredible belief in their vision.",
