  biography:
    "Marc Merrill's journey to co-founding Riot Games is a fascinating tale of turning frustration into innovation. What makes his story unique is how he and Brandon Beck transformed from frustrated gamers to industry revolutionaries. His most controversial early decision was making League of Legends completely free when premium games dominated the market. He famously played under the username 'Tryndamere' (now a champion in the game) and would regularly interact with players without revealing his identity to get unfiltered feedback. His most audacious move was investing millions in esports when many thought competitive gaming was a fad. During the early days, he and Beck would personally respond to player feedback on forums at 3 AM, establishing Riot's culture of extreme player focus.",
