  biography:
    "Marc Randolph's journey to co-founding Netflix is a fascinating tale of persistence and experimentation. What makes his story unique is how a series of commute conversations with Reed Hastings turned into a revolution in entertainment. His most controversial early decision was to focus on DVDs when VHS dominated the market. He famously tested the DVD-by-mail concept by mailing himself a CD in a greeting card envelope to see if it would break. His most brilliant innovation was creating the subscription model when everyone else was charging per rental. During Netflix's early days, he personally wrote many of the customer service emails, and once drove to a customer's house to diagnose a website problem, only to discover they were using their CD-ROM drive as a cup holder.",
