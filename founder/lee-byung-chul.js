  biography:
    "Lee Byung-chul's transformation of Samsung from a small noodle trading company to a global technology giant is one of business history's most fascinating pivots. What makes his story unique is his contrarian approach to business expansion - while others focused on single industries, he built Samsung through constant diversification. His most controversial decision came during the Korean War when he moved his headquarters to Busan and started a sugar refinery while the country was still at war. He famously sold his wife's jewelry to keep the company afloat during difficult times. His most audacious move was entering the electronics industry in 1969 when Korea had almost no technological infrastructure - he sent engineers to Japan to learn TV manufacturing secretly, then reverse-engineered Japanese products.",
